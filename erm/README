First, attempt at getting a simple game up and running.


# Todo

- nicer diamond follow animation.
  should follow actual path, like on grid

- when player is just a  head, Onna will blow little heart powerups
  which will play an animation and reset

- diamonds will weight Hito down

- when all diamonds collected, Onna will turn into a purple diamond
- upon collecting the purple diamond, launch terrfying boss to eat everything

- have to jump on gremlin to get up to onna, jumping puzzle, then end game with
  cute animation. Maybe spawn lots of little mixed colour heads?????
